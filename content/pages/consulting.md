Kevin is available on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. Weekly availability is subject to advanced scheduling and a penalty for cancelation. Any potential engagement will begin with a free phone/video call to assess your needs, understand your goals, and discuss how he can help.

Each engagement will be unique as each company and challenge is different. Kevin does not bring a one-size-fits-all approach nor a set of fixed solutions that he will impose on your unique problems. He works to understand what makes your team distinctive. Then builds on that to help you address your current challenges and put a framework in place to help guide you moving forward. A framework aligned with who your company is and what you aspire for it to be.

- Reviewing pitch decks for startups and making suggestions for improvement
- Reviewing initial engineering proposals and estimates from third-party development partners
- Performing due diligence on potential investments and acquisitions for established investors and companies
- Attending leadership meetings to identify harmful patterns and help improve team dynamics
